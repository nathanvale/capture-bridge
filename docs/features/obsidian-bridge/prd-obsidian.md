# PRD: Obsidian Bridge
Problem: Users must see captures appear in the right PARA place reliably.

Goals:
- Atomic writes, daily note backlinks, conflict safety

Scope:
- Vault connector, template-aware filenames, sibling-on-conflict

Decisions:
- Obsidian is canonical; bridge is one-way; inbox approvals drive learning
