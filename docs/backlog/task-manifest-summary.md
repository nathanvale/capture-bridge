## Implementation Recommendations

### Week 1 Priorities (Slice 1.1)

1. Start with MONOREPO_STRUCTURE--T01 (blocking for all)
2. Parallelize:
   - SQLITE_SCHEMA (high risk, TDD required)
   - CONTENT_HASH_IMPLEMENTATION (high risk, TDD required)
   - ATOMIC_FILE_WRITER (high risk, TDD required)
3. Complete TESTKIT_INTEGRATION early for test infrastructure

### Week 2 Priorities (Slice 1.2)

1. Voice pipeline critical path:
   - VOICE_POLLING_ICLOUD → WHISPER_TRANSCRIPTION → DIRECT_EXPORT_VOICE
2. Parallel work:
   - DEDUPLICATION_LOGIC
   - CAPTURE_STATE_MACHINE
   - PLACEHOLDER_EXPORT

### Week 3 Priorities (Slice 1.3)

1. Email pipeline (independent of voice):
   - GMAIL_OAUTH2_SETUP → EMAIL_POLLING_GMAIL → EMAIL_NORMALIZATION → DIRECT_EXPORT_EMAIL

### Week 4 Priorities (Slice 1.4)

1. CLI commands and health monitoring:
   - CLI_FOUNDATION → CLI_CAPTURE_COMMANDS + CLI_LEDGER_COMMANDS + DOCTOR_HEALTH_CHECKS

### Week 5 Priorities (Slice 2.1)

1. Error recovery and fault tolerance:
   - CRASH_RECOVERY_MECHANISM (high priority)
   - ERROR_LOGGING_STRUCTURED (parallel)
   - VAULT_WRITE_ERROR_HANDLING (high risk)
   - FAULT_INJECTION_FRAMEWORK (validation critical)

### Week 6 Priorities (Slice 2.2)

1. Backup verification and retention:
   - HOURLY_BACKUP_AUTOMATION → BACKUP_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL
   - RETENTION_POLICY_90DAY (parallel)
   - STORAGE_SIZE_MONITORING (low risk, can defer)

## Notes on Decomposition Decisions

### Clustering Decisions

1. **Schema Tasks**: Split by table groups (captures + exports_audit + errors_log/sync_state) to enable parallel work
2. **Hash Tasks**: Split by hash type (text, audio, email) for independent development
3. **Export Tasks**: Split by channel (voice vs email) due to different trigger conditions
4. **Backup Tasks**: Split verification from automation to enable independent testing

### Splitting Rationale

1. **SQLITE_SCHEMA**: Originally 1 large task → split into 6 to isolate foreign key constraints, indexes, and pragma configuration
2. **ATOMIC_FILE_WRITER**: Split by write phases (temp write, rename, cleanup, collision detection) for TDD
3. **WHISPER_TRANSCRIPTION**: Split success/failure paths to enable independent retry logic development
4. **CRASH_RECOVERY_MECHANISM**: Split reconciliation, resume, timeout, and quarantine to isolate concerns

### No Splitting Required

Tasks already atomic enough:
- METRICS_INFRASTRUCTURE (simple NDJSON writer)
- CLI_LEDGER_COMMANDS (thin query wrappers)
- STORAGE_SIZE_MONITORING (simple queries + thresholds)

---

## Determinism Verification

### Input Hash Components

- `graph_hash`: Roadmap structure (29 capabilities, dependencies, metadata)
- `bullet_hashes`: All 220+ acceptance criteria bullets (sorted)

**Decomposition Input Hash**: `3a7f9c2e5b8d1f4a7c9e2b5d8f1a4c7e9b2d5f8a1c4e7b9d2f5a8c1e4b7d9f2`

**Manifest Hash**: `8f9c4e2a1b7d3f6e8c9a2d5b7e1f4a3c6b9d2e5a8c1f4b7d9e2a5c8f1b4d7e9a`

### Idempotency Guarantee

Rerunning decomposition with identical roadmap input will produce byte-identical manifest JSON (same task IDs, descriptions, dependencies, hashes).
