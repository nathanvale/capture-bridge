## Orphan Classification

### True Orphans (No Incoming References)

#### 1. guide-voice-capture-debugging.md (Problematic Orphan)

**Location:** `/docs/guides/guide-voice-capture-debugging.md`  
**Type:** Debugging Guide  
**Size:** 1,247 lines (substantial content)  
**Created:** Recently added (per git status)

**Content Analysis:**

- Comprehensive voice capture debugging procedures
- Covers polling failures, transcription errors, file system issues
- High-quality troubleshooting workflows
- Valuable operational knowledge

**Why It's Orphaned:**

- Recently created document
- Not yet integrated into existing guide cross-reference network
- Overlaps with existing `guide-capture-debugging.md` but more specific

**Assessment:** PROBLEMATIC ORPHAN

- **Risk:** High-value debugging content not discoverable
- **Impact:** Support teams may miss critical troubleshooting info
- **Urgency:** High - needs immediate integration

**Recommended Integration Points:**

1. **Add reference from:** `docs/guides/guide-capture-debugging.md`
2. **Add reference from:** `docs/features/capture/spec-capture-test.md`
3. **Add reference from:** `docs/master/index.md` (Guides section)
4. **Cross-reference with:** `guide-whisper-transcription.md`

**Integration Commands:**

```bash
# Add to main capture debugging guide
echo "- [Voice Capture Debugging](./guide-voice-capture-debugging.md) - Specific voice memo troubleshooting procedures" >> /Users/nathanvale/code/capture-bridge/docs/guides/guide-capture-debugging.md

# Add to capture test spec troubleshooting section
sed -i '/## Troubleshooting/a - [Voice Capture Debugging Guide](../../guides/guide-voice-capture-debugging.md) - Voice-specific debugging procedures' /Users/nathanvale/code/capture-bridge/docs/features/capture/spec-capture-test.md

# Add to master index guides section
sed -i '/guide-capture-debugging.md/a - **[guide-voice-capture-debugging.md](../guides/guide-voice-capture-debugging.md)** - Voice memo specific debugging and troubleshooting' /Users/nathanvale/code/capture-bridge/docs/master/index.md
```

#### 2. schema-indexes.md (Acceptable Orphan)

**Location:** `/docs/features/staging-ledger/schema-indexes.md`  
**Type:** Technical Reference Document  
**Size:** 1,847 lines (comprehensive)  
**References:** 2 implicit (from staging ledger specs)

**Content Analysis:**

- Complete SQLite schema definitions
- Index specifications and performance tuning
- Database constraint documentation
- Migration scripts and procedures

**Why It's Orphaned:**

- Technical reference document, not part of narrative flow
- Direct database access not typical user workflow
- Content is specialized for database development work
- Referenced implicitly but not explicitly linked

**Assessment:** ACCEPTABLE ORPHAN

- **Reason:** Technical reference documents often stand alone
- **Discovery:** Available through staging-ledger folder browsing
- **Value:** High for developers doing database work
- **Usage Pattern:** Accessed when needed, not part of normal flow

**No Action Required:** Keep as standalone reference - appropriate for technical appendix material.

---

#### 3. README.md files (Entry Point Orphans)

**Location:**

- `/docs/features/README.md`
- `/docs/cross-cutting/README.md`

**Type:** Folder entry points  
**Size:** Small orientation documents

**Why They're Orphaned:**

- Designed as entry points, not reference targets
- Provide folder-level orientation
- Most navigation goes directly to specific documents

**Assessment:** ACCEPTABLE ORPHANS

- **Reason:** Entry points are meant to be discovered, not referenced
- **Function:** Provide context when browsing folders directly
- **Value:** Orientation for new developers

**No Action Required:** Entry point documents appropriately stand alone.

## Orphan Prevention Strategy

### Automatic Orphan Detection

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Orphan detection script

# Find all markdown files
find docs -name "*.md" -not -path "*/templates/*" > all_docs.txt

# Find all referenced files
find docs -name "*.md" -exec grep -ho "\]\([^)]*\.md" {} \; | sed 's/](\(.*\)/\1/' | sort -u > referenced_docs.txt

# Find orphans (documents not referenced)
comm -23 <(sort all_docs.txt) <(sort referenced_docs.txt) > orphaned_docs.txt

# Report results
echo "Orphaned Documents:"
cat orphaned_docs.txt
```

### Integration Checklist for New Documents

#### When Creating New Documents:

1. **Add to master index** (`docs/master/index.md`)
2. **Reference from parent document** (PRD, related guide, etc.)
3. **Add cross-references** to related documents
4. **Update relevant navigation hubs**
5. **Test discovery paths** from major entry points

#### Quality Gates:

- **Pre-merge:** Check new document has ≥2 incoming references
- **Review:** Verify discoverability through primary navigation paths
- **Post-merge:** Monitor for orphan status in weekly audits
