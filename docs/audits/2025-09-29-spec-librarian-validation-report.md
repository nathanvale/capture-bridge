## ‚ùå OUTSTANDING CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. Broken Cross-References - NOT FIXED ‚ùå
**Status:** 8 critical broken references remain active in 9 files

**Still Broken:**
- `spec-cli-doctor-tech.md` ‚Üí Referenced but file doesn't exist
- `spec-capture-gmail-oauth2-tech.md` ‚Üí Referenced but file doesn't exist  
- `spec-capture-whisper-runtime-tech.md` ‚Üí Referenced but file doesn't exist
- `../cross-cutting/foundation/spec-cli-tech.md` ‚Üí Wrong path (should be features)
- `../cross-cutting/foundation/spec-cli-test.md` ‚Üí Wrong path (should be features)
- `spec-testkit-tech.md` ‚Üí External library, shouldn't be referenced as internal spec
- `spec-error-recovery-tech.md` ‚Üí Should reference guide, not spec

**Files Still Containing Broken References:**
1. `docs/guides/guide-backup-verification.md`
2. `docs/guides/guide-backup-restore-drill.md`  
3. `docs/guides/guide-cli-doctor-implementation.md`
4. `docs/guides/guide-phase1-testing-patterns.md`
5. `docs/guides/guide-tdd-applicability.md`
6. `docs/cross-cutting/prd-foundation-monorepo.md`
7. `docs/cross-cutting/spec-metrics-contract-tech-test.md`

### 2. Path Classification Issues - NOT FIXED ‚ùå
**Issue:** CLI specs still referenced in wrong location (cross-cutting vs features)

Master PRD still contains:
- `../cross-cutting/foundation/spec-cli-tech.md` (should be `../features/cli/spec-cli-tech.md`)
- `../cross-cutting/foundation/spec-cli-test.md` (should be `../features/cli/spec-cli-test.md`)

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Status:** REMEDIATION INCOMPLETE - Critical issues still block Phase 1 readiness

### P0 Critical Fixes Still Needed:

```bash
# Fix missing spec references (point to existing sections)
sed -i 's|spec-cli-doctor-tech.md|spec-cli-tech.md#doctor-command|g' docs/guides/guide-backup-verification.md
sed -i 's|spec-cli-doctor-tech.md|spec-cli-tech.md#doctor-command|g' docs/guides/guide-backup-restore-drill.md  
sed -i 's|spec-cli-doctor-tech.md|spec-cli-tech.md#doctor-command|g' docs/guides/guide-cli-doctor-implementation.md

# Fix wrong paths (CLI is feature, not cross-cutting)  
sed -i 's|../cross-cutting/foundation/spec-cli-tech.md|../features/cli/spec-cli-tech.md|g' docs/cross-cutting/prd-foundation-monorepo.md

# Fix external TestKit reference

## üìà IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY

**Target Health Score:** 95/100  
**Current Progress:** 85/100 (85% of target)  
**Remaining Work:** 10 points (primarily cross-reference fixes)

**Estimated Time to Target:** 1-2 hours for critical fixes
