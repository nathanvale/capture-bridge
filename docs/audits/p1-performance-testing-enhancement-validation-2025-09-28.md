## TDD Applicability Compliance

### Risk Classification Alignment

All new performance tests follow the TDD Applicability Guide risk classification:

**High Risk (TDD Required)** - All implemented tests:

- Core business logic stability (CLI command reliability)

**Medium Risk (TDD Strongly Recommended)** - Enhanced coverage:
- Performance-critical paths (all P95 latency gates)
- Complex algorithmic logic (hash computation, deduplication)
- External service integrations (fault injection tests)

**Test Strategy Matrix Compliance**:
- **Unit Tests**: Pure logic transforms (parsers, hash functions)
- **Integration Tests**: Database and file system boundaries
- **Contract Tests**: External API boundaries with mocks
- **Load Tests**: System-level throughput and reliability
