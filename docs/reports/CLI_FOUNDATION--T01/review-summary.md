## Quick Facts

- ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria met
- ✓ 173 tests passing
- ✓ 88.19% statement coverage (exceeds 80% target)
- ✗ 3 critical blocking issues prevent merge
- ✗ Doctor command has placeholder implementation
- ✗ Health checks not integrated
- ✗ Commands don't use error handling framework

---

## P0 Critical Blockers (MUST FIX)

### 1. Doctor Command is Placeholder
**File:** `src/commands/doctor.ts:138-142`
**Issue:** Action handler logs options instead of executing `runDoctorCommand`
**Impact:** Doctor command doesn't work
**Fix Time:** 15 minutes

### 2. Health Checks Not Integrated
**File:** `src/commands/doctor.ts:25-86`
**Issue:** `runDoctorCommand` runs mocks only, doesn't invoke actual health services
**Impact:** No real health checks execute
**Fix Time:** 30 minutes

### 3. Type Validation Missing at Command Boundary
**File:** `src/commands/*.ts` all files
**Issue:** Command options are `Record<string, unknown>` instead of validated types
**Impact:** Validation schemas not enforced; no type safety at CLI entry point
**Fix Time:** 30 minutes

---

## P1 High-Impact Issues

### 1. Commands Don't Throw CLIError
- Error handling framework defined but unused in commands
- No try-catch in any command action
- `validateInput` utility exists but not used
- **Impact:** Error handling path completely untested in production code

### 2. Exit Code Validation Untested
- `isValidExitCode` function has 0% coverage
- No tests validate type guard behavior
- **Impact:** Exit code contract not validated

### 3. Health Check Type Mismatch
- `HealthCheckOutput` (output-formatter) vs `DoctorResult` (types) incompatible
- Field naming inconsistent (passed/pass, warnings/warn)
- Exit code representation differs
- **Impact:** JSON output schema unstable

### 4. Async/Await Mismatch
- `runDoctorCommand` synchronous but health checks async
- Will fail when integrated
- **Impact:** Blocks P0-002 resolution

## Code Quality

✓ **Strengths:**
- Clean error handling architecture
- Proper TDD patterns in tests
- Good test cleanup (5-step TestKit pattern)
- Type-safe schemas with Zod
- Comprehensive help text

✗ **Weaknesses:**
- Placeholder implementations block functionality
- Gap between test structure and production integration
- Async/await contract mismatch
- Type validation not enforced at boundaries

---

## Test Results

```
✓ 173 tests passed
✓ 9 test files
✓ 88.19% coverage (exceeds 80% target)
✓ All cleanup patterns correct
✗ Integration gaps in doctor command
```

---

## Merge Decision

**DO NOT MERGE** until P0 issues resolved.

**Estimated Fix Time:** 4-6 hours for all P0 and P1 issues

**Next Step:** Contact developer to resolve critical blockers in this branch.
