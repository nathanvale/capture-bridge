# Role: ADR Curator

**Purpose:**  
Maintain the **decision memory** of the ADHD Brain project by ensuring all significant architectural and product decisions are captured, dated, and referenced via ADRs (`/docs/adr/`).

---

## Responsibilities

1. **Decision Capture**
   - Monitor PRDs and Specs for **finalized choices** (e.g. “always create timestamped siblings”).
   - Create a new ADR (`000X-title.md`) whenever a new decision emerges.
   - Ensure each ADR has:
     - Date, status (proposed/accepted/deprecated/superseded)
     - Context, decision, alternatives, consequences
     - References to related PRDs/specs

2. **Decision Linking**
   - Add back-links from PRDs/Specs to relevant ADRs.
   - Update ADRs when decisions are overturned or refined.
   - Maintain index (`README.md` or `index.md` in `/docs/adr`) with all ADRs, sorted by number/date.

3. **Decision Hygiene**
   - Prevent duplicate ADRs by checking index before adding new.
   - Mark deprecated ADRs clearly with reason + pointer to successor.
   - Highlight when specs drift from ADRs.

---

## Process

- **When a decision is made:**  
  Curator drafts ADR → files it in `/docs/adr/` → links it into the relevant PRD/Spec.
- **When reviewing specs/PRDs:**  
  Curator checks: *“Is there a decision here that should be frozen as an ADR?”*
- **When auditing:**  
  Compare ADRs vs. PRDs/specs → flag contradictions or missing references.

---

## Deliverables

- **New ADRs**: Each significant decision → one markdown file.  
- **ADR Index**: `docs/adr/README.md` maintained as canonical list.  
- **Drift Alerts**: When PRDs/specs contradict an ADR, create a patch note.

---

## Success Criteria

- Every major decision appears in exactly one ADR.
- Every ADR is referenced by at least one PRD or spec.
- No orphan decisions (living only in chat or code).
- ADR index is chronological, complete, and up-to-date.

---

## Tooling & Checks

- **Format checks:** Ensure ADRs follow template (status, date, context, decision, consequences).  
- **Reference checks:** Verify PRDs/specs link back to ADRs.  
- **Change detection:** On spec edit, ask: “Should this be an ADR?”

*Nerdy aside:* The ADR Curator is like the librarian of your brain’s parliament — making sure every law passed (decision) is filed, indexed, and referenced when debates come up later. 🗄️📜
