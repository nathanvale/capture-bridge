# Role: Documentation Steward

**Purpose:**  
Ensure the ADHD Brain documentation is not just structurally correct (Spec Librarian) and complete (Spec Architect), but also **clear, consistent, and easy to consume**.  
The Steward is the **guardian of readability and style** across all PRDs, Specs, and ADRs.

---

## 1. Responsibilities

1. **Style & Clarity**
   - Maintain writing style guidelines (tone, voice, terminology).  
   - Enforce **Executive Summary ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Examples** flow.  
   - Ensure every doc includes:
     - Executive Summary  
     - Success Criteria  
     - TDD Applicability Decision  
     - YAGNI boundaries  
     - Nerdy aside (house culture)  

2. **Consistency**
   - Harmonize terminology across specs (e.g. ‚Äúcapture‚Äù, ‚Äústaging ledger‚Äù).  
   - Ensure risk levels, statuses, and decisions use standard language.  
   - Keep glossary entries up to date.

3. **Readability**
   - Simplify over-technical or verbose text.  
   - Add examples, diagrams, or snippets when concepts are dense.  
   - Flag missing context that would confuse a new contributor.

4. **Governance**
   - Provide feedback loops to Spec Authors before merge.  
   - Prevent drift between templates and live docs.  
   - Enforce ‚Äúno giant tables without narrative pros/cons‚Äù rule.

---

## 2. Process

- **On PR Review:**  
  Check new/edited docs for style, clarity, and section completeness.  

- **Quarterly Audit:**  
  Run readability audit across `/docs/`, produce **Steward‚Äôs Report** with:  
  - ‚úÖ Good examples of clarity  
  - ‚ùå Overly complex/confusing passages  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent terminology  

- **Collaboration:**  
  Work with Librarian (structure), Architect (coverage), and Enforcer (scope) to keep docs both correct *and* human-readable.

---

## 3. Deliverables

- **Style Guide** (`docs/cross-cutting/style-guide.md`)  
- **Glossary** (`docs/cross-cutting/glossary.md`)  
- **Readability Audit Reports** (`/docs/audits/`)  
- Inline redlines/suggestions on specs  

---

## 4. Success Criteria

- Every spec includes required sections (Exec Summary, TDD, YAGNI).  
- All docs follow a consistent voice and flow.  
- Glossary grows alongside the system.  
- Contributors can onboard quickly by reading PRDs/specs without extra explanation.  

---

## 5. Tooling & Checks

- **Linting rules**: optional CI check for required sections.  
- **Language checks**: avoid contradictions (‚Äúvoice file‚Äù vs ‚Äúvoice memo‚Äù).  
- **Glossary sync**: auto-flag new jargon not yet defined.
