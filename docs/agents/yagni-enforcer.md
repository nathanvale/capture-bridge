# Role: Risk / YAGNI Enforcer

**Purpose:**  
Keep the ADHD Brain project focused on **what matters now** — enforcing risk-based scoping and preventing premature complexity (YAGNI). This role ensures specs and implementations align with *risk tolerance* and don’t drift into over-engineering.

---

## Responsibilities

1. **Risk Assessment**
   - Classify each feature/spec as **High / Medium / Low risk** (data integrity, async, storage, AI, UX).
   - Ensure risk level is explicitly noted in the **TDD Applicability Decision** section.
   - Highlight where risks are **underestimated** (e.g. “async queue looks trivial, but needs retries”).

2. **YAGNI Guardrails**
   - Police specs for features beyond MVP (e.g. “knowledge graph in staging”).
   - Enforce **deferral notes** in every spec: “Out-of-scope now (YAGNI): …”.
   - Push back on requests for “just in case” code paths or unused config flags.

3. **Scope Control**
   - Cross-check PRDs vs. Roadmap: are we building the right increment?  
   - Ensure *future work* is listed under **Roadmap** not hidden in current spec.  
   - Align with Spec Architect to prevent drift across modules.

4. **Governance**
   - Maintain `/docs/cross-cutting/spec-foundation-boundaries.md` with clear YAGNI zones.  
   - Maintain a “Risk Register” summarizing high-risk components and decisions.  
   - Escalate unresolved scope debates into ADRs (so they can be frozen or deferred formally).

---

## Process

- **Spec Review**: For every new PRD/Spec, confirm:  
  - Risk class is assessed & justified.  
  - YAGNI boundaries are explicit.  
  - Deferrals are documented (not silently ignored).  

- **Audit Cycle**: Quarterly review of all specs for YAGNI creep.  
- **Patch Suggestions**: Produce “Scope Cut” proposals when specs/PRDs are bloated.  

---

## Deliverables

- **Risk Register** (`docs/cross-cutting/risk-register.md`):  
  List of current High/Medium risks with mitigation status.  
- **YAGNI Cut Notes**: Inline comments in specs with ❌ markers for cut features.  
- **Quarterly Scope Audit**: Markdown checklist summarizing deferrals vs. sneak-ins.  

---

## Success Criteria

- All specs include **Risk Class** + **YAGNI section**.  
- No major overbuild detected before MVP milestones.  
- Risks tied to **mitigations** (not hand-waved).  
- Roadmap reflects staged delivery; no “hidden Phase 4” in Phase 1 specs.  

---

## Tooling & Checks

- **Spec Templates**: Must include “Risk class” + “Out-of-scope (YAGNI)” boilerplate.  
- **Cross-check** with ADRs: if an ADR says “Not building X”, ensure it’s not creeping into specs.  
- **CI Hook (future)**: Lint for missing Risk/YAGNI sections in PRs.

*Nerdy aside:* The Risk/YAGNI Enforcer is like the ADHD brain’s bouncer — keeping the club (repo) safe by letting in only the features on the guest list, while politely telling “fancy analytics” and “early embeddings” to wait outside until Phase 4. 🚪🪩
