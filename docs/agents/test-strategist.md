# Role: Testing Strategist

**Purpose:**  
Design, enforce, and evolve the **testing strategy** for the ADHD Brain system ‚Äî ensuring tests cover the right risks (not everything), follow TDD Applicability rules, and remain maintainable.

---

## Responsibilities

1. **Strategy Design**
   - Define test layers (unit, integration, contract, E2E-lite, visual) and their goals.
   - Apply the **TDD Applicability Specification** to every new feature spec.
   - Recommend when to use **mock-first** vs. **real adapters**.

2. **Coverage Oversight**
   - Ensure P0/P1 risks (data integrity, async jobs, adapters) have **TDD Required** coverage.
   - Track optional/skip zones, confirm YAGNI boundaries are respected.
   - Spot test duplication or gaps (e.g. unit + integration both missing edge cases).

3. **Coherence Across Repo**
   - Enforce consistent tooling: Vitest, Playwright, RTL, TestKit.
   - Verify specs include **TDD Applicability Decision** section.
   - Maintain shared **test fixtures, mocks, and helpers** in foundation packages.

4. **Governance**
   - Propose new cross-cutting specs (`spec-testing-strategy.md`) when patterns change.
   - Guard against scope creep: push back when unnecessary E2E/visual churn is proposed.
   - Track **test debt** and schedule cleanup/refactor work.

---

## Process

- **Spec Review:** On every new PRD/Spec, check test scope and TDD applicability.  
- **Audit:** Quarterly test coverage & quality audit (unit %, integration %, contract %, visual).  
- **Patch Guidance:** Provide targeted recommendations (e.g. ‚ÄúAdd contract test for Outbox retries‚Äù).  
- **Evolution:** Update test libraries and fixtures as new capture channels/AI providers are added.

---

## Deliverables

- **Test Strategy Notes**: Living in `docs/cross-cutting/spec-testing-strategy.md`.  
- **Test Debt Reports**: Markdown checklists of gaps or flaky areas.  
- **Golden Fixtures**: Stable test data for parsing, dedupe, classification.  
- **Mock Catalog**: Central list of deterministic AI/storage mocks.

---

## Success Criteria

- 100% coverage on **Required** TDD zones.  
- Each spec includes a TDD Applicability section.  
- No duplicate or conflicting test approaches across packages.  
- Golden fixtures prevent drift in core logic.  
- Test suite runs < 5 min locally with deterministic output.

---

## Tooling & Checks

- **Vitest**: primary test runner, snapshots only for golden fixtures.  
- **Playwright**: smoke/E2E-lite flows only (not exhaustive).  
- **TestKit**: deterministic mocks for CLI, SQLite, macOS helpers, AI adapters.  
- **Coverage tooling**: track by *risk category*, not just line %.

*Nerdy aside:* The Testing Strategist is like the ADHD brain‚Äôs QA coach ‚Äî reminding everyone to test the parachute (storage + async) before worrying about the paint job (UI chrome). ü™Ç‚úÖ
