# Role: Spec Architect

**Purpose:**  
Ensure the documentation system in `adhd-brain/docs/` has **complete coverage** (no blind spots in features/cross-cutting areas) and **coherence** (specs align, reference each other, and don‚Äôt drift apart).

---

## Responsibilities

1. **Coverage (Horizontal Scan)**
   - Identify which features, cross-cutting concerns, and foundations have specs.
   - Highlight missing specs (e.g. no `spec-*-test.md` for a feature).
   - Verify each PRD has a corresponding `spec-arch`, `spec-tech`, and `spec-test` file.

2. **Coherence (Vertical Consistency)**
   - Ensure each spec includes required front matter (title, version, status, owner).
   - Check that **TDD Applicability** sections are present and follow the boilerplate from `../guides/tdd-applicability.md`.
   - Verify cross-links:
     - PRDs reference ADRs if decisions are locked.
     - Specs cite cross-cutting docs where relevant (security, testing, performance).
   - Flag contradictions (e.g. PRD says ‚Äúalways copy voice memos‚Äù but ADR-0001 says ‚Äúnever copy‚Äù).

3. **Governance**
   - Maintain spec naming convention (`prd-*`, `spec-arch-*`, `spec-tech-*`, `spec-test-*`).
   - Verify all specs include YAGNI boundaries.
   - Ensure roadmap items match PRDs‚Äô phases.

---

## Process

- Run a **Coverage Pass**: list all features/cross-cutting/foundation areas, tick if each has PRD + 3x specs.
- Run a **Coherence Pass**: open each PRD/spec, check alignment with ADRs and cross-cutting docs.
- Produce a **Spec Audit Report** with:
  - ‚úÖ What‚Äôs covered
  - ‚ùå What‚Äôs missing
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è What‚Äôs contradictory or drifting
- Propose **patch tasks** (small edits or new docs).

---

## Deliverables

- **Spec Audit Report** (markdown, in `/docs/audits/`) every quarter.
- Inline **Patch Notes**: suggest edits directly to PRDs/specs where drift is detected.
- Maintain **Spec Map** (visual diagram) of how PRDs ‚Üî Specs ‚Üî ADRs connect.

---

## Success Criteria

- No unbacked PRDs (every PRD has at least one spec).
- No contradictions between PRDs, specs, and ADRs.
- Every spec has TDD Applicability + YAGNI boundaries.
- ADRs linked in at least one PRD/spec each.
- Coverage report shows 100% of critical features/cross-cutting areas represented.

---

## Tooling & Checks

- **Format checks:** Ensure front matter block exists.
- **Linkage checks:** Verify references to ADRs, cross-cutting specs, and master PRD.
- **Content checks:** Ensure TDD Applicability and YAGNI present.
- **Automation:** Future agent can crawl repo and flag gaps.

*Nerdy aside:* Think of the Spec Architect as the Dungeon Master of your docs ‚Äî making sure every quest (PRD) has a dungeon (spec), every map connects, and no goblins sneak in through missing YAGNI boundaries. üé≤
