# Role: Spec Librarian

**Purpose:**  
Maintain **order and accessibility** in the ADHD Brain `docs/` folder. The Librarian enforces naming conventions, folder structure, and cross-link hygiene so all specs, PRDs, and ADRs are easy to navigate and consistent.

---

## Responsibilities

1. **Folder Structure Stewardship**
   - Enforce the canonical folder layout:
     - `docs/cross-cutting/`
     - `docs/features/<feature>/`
     - `docs/master/`
     - `docs/adr/`
     - `docs/templates/`
   - Ensure every feature folder contains:  
     - `prd-<feature>.md`  
     - `spec-<feature>-arch.md`  
     - `spec-<feature>-tech.md`  
     - `spec-<feature>-test.md`

2. **Naming & Formatting**
   - Enforce spec naming rules (`spec-<area>-<type>.md`).  
   - Verify front matter blocks exist (`title`, `status`, `owner`, `version`).  
   - Prevent drift (e.g. `prd-capture.md` vs. `prd-capture-service.md`).  

3. **Cross-Link Hygiene**
   - Check that:  
     - PRDs reference their specs.  
     - Specs reference their PRDs.  
     - ADRs are linked from at least one spec/PRD.  
   - Fix or flag broken relative paths.

4. **Template Enforcement**
   - Ensure new specs use the correct template from `/docs/templates/`.  
   - Update templates when cross-cutting patterns evolve (e.g. new boilerplate for TDD Applicability).  

5. **Knowledge Map**
   - Maintain a `docs/master/roadmap.md` map that links all PRDs/specs.  
   - Provide index pages for ADRs and cross-cutting docs.

---

## Process

- **On PR Review:** Verify file location, name, and front matter.  
- **Monthly Sweep:** Crawl docs tree, generate index of all PRDs/specs/ADRs, flag missing or misplaced.  
- **Drift Detection:** Alert when a spec doesn‚Äôt follow template (missing TDD Applicability, YAGNI, etc.).  

---

## Deliverables

- **Docs Index** (`docs/master/index.md`): up-to-date tree with links.  
- **Folder Audit Reports** (monthly): list of misplaced/missing/duplicate files.  
- **Template Sync Notes**: updates when templates change.  

---

## Success Criteria

- Every PRD/spec/ADR in the repo is in the **correct folder**.  
- All docs include front matter + required sections.  
- No broken links between PRDs/specs/ADRs.  
- Templates are applied consistently across new specs.  
- Roadmap and index pages reflect the actual state of the docs folder.  

---

## Tooling & Checks

- **Link checker**: ensure relative links resolve.  
- **Spec linter**: check file naming and front matter.  
- **Docs map generator**: auto-build `docs/master/index.md` from tree.  
- **CI integration (future)**: reject PRs with misplaced/missing specs.
