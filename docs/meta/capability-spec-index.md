| Category | Total Capabilities | Fully Documented | Partial | Missing | Coverage % |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Phase 1 (Core Ingestion)** | 7 | 7 | 0 | 0 | **100%** |
| **Phase 2 (Hardening)** | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | **100%** |

**Status:** All MPPP capabilities now have complete documentation coverage!

---

### 2.2 4-Document Rule Compliance

**Target:** All Phase 1-2 features should have complete PRD → ARCH → TECH → TEST chains.

| Feature | PRD | ARCH | TECH | TEST | Compliance | Gap |
|---------|-----|------|------|------|------------|-----|
| **Capture** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **100%** | None |
| **Staging Ledger** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **100%** | None |
| **CLI** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **100%** | None |
| **Obsidian Bridge** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **100%** | None |

**Note:** Cross-cutting infrastructure may have TECH-only specs per architectural pattern (infrastructure-focused components). Foundation Monorepo has complete PRD + ARCH + TECH + TEST documentation given its critical foundational role.

---

## 3. Orphaned Spec Detection

**Definition:** Orphaned specs are documents that do not map to any Master PRD capability or Roadmap phase.

### 3.1 Active Specs (No Orphans Detected)

All Phase 1-2 specs map to Master PRD capabilities:

- ✅ Capture PRD/ARCH/TECH/TEST → Voice + Email Capture capabilities
- ✅ Staging Ledger PRD/ARCH/TECH/TEST → Staging, Deduplication, Audit Trail capabilities
- ✅ CLI PRD/ARCH/TECH/TEST → Health Command capability
- ✅ Obsidian Bridge PRD/ARCH/TECH/TEST → Direct Inbox Export capability
- ✅ Foundation PRD/TECH → Monorepo Foundation infrastructure
- ✅ Direct Export TECH → Direct Inbox Export capability (supporting spec)
- ✅ Metrics Contract TECH → Basic Observability capability (supporting spec)

**Result:** Zero orphaned active specs.

---

### 3.2 Deferred Specs (Properly Archived)

| Spec | Location | Status | Recommendation |
|------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Intelligence PRD/ARCH/TECH/TEST** | `/features/intelligence/` | Skeletal (Phase 5+ deferred) | ✅ Keep as future reference |
| **Inbox PRD/ARCH/TECH/TEST** | `/features/inbox/` (empty except `.gitkeep`) | Deleted (Phase 5+ deferred) | ✅ Correct - no premature work |

**Result:** Deferred features properly marked, no cleanup needed.

---

### 3.3 Archived Specs (Historical)

| Spec | Location | Status | Recommendation |
|------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Historical foundation specs | `/archive/phase1-deferred/` | Superseded by MPPP scope reduction | ✅ Keep for historical context |
| Pre-MPPP intelligence specs | `/archive/phase1-deferred/` | Superseded by MPPP scope reduction | ✅ Keep for historical context |

**Result:** Archive structure correct, no action needed.

---

## 4. Version Alignment Audit

### 4.1 Master PRD Version References

## 5. ADR Linkage Matrix

### 5.1 ADR → Capability Mapping

| ADR | Decision | Impacted Capabilities | Referenced From | Status |
|-----|----------|----------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **[ADR-0001](../adr/0001-voice-file-sovereignty.md)** | Voice File Sovereignty | Voice Capture, Staging Ledger | Master PRD, Capture PRD/ARCH/TECH, Staging PRD/ARCH, Roadmap | Accepted |
| **[ADR-0002](../adr/0002-dual-hash-migration.md)** | Dual Hash Migration (SHA-256 → BLAKE3) | Content Hash Deduplication | Master PRD, Roadmap, Capture TECH | Proposed (Deferred Phase 2+) |

**Result:** All accepted ADRs are properly linked from implementing specs.

---

### 5.2 ADR Compliance Audit

**ADR-0001 (Voice File Sovereignty) Enforcement:**

| Spec | Compliance | Evidence |
|------|------------|----------|
| Master PRD | ✅ Compliant | "never move, rename, or duplicate" (Section 4.2) |

## 8. Maintenance Procedures

### 8.1 When Adding New Capabilities

1. **Add to Master PRD** (Section 5 - Functional Requirements)
2. **Update Roadmap** with phase assignment and dependencies
3. **Create Feature PRD** in `/features/<feature>/`
4. **Create Spec Chain** (ARCH → TECH → TEST)
5. **Update this Index** with new capability mapping
6. **Link ADRs** if new architectural decisions required
7. **Create Guides** if cross-cutting patterns emerge

---

### 8.2 When Marking Capabilities as Complete

1. **Verify 4-document rule** (PRD + ARCH + TECH + TEST exist)
2. **Update Status column** in Section 1 mapping tables
3. **Update Coverage Metrics** in Section 2
4. **Validate ADR compliance** if applicable
5. **Check for orphaned specs** that should be archived

---

### 8.3 When Deferring Capabilities

1. **Document trigger condition** in Roadmap
2. **Update Status column** to "Deferred Phase X+"
3. **Move specs to archive** if superseded by MPPP scope
4. **Add to Section 1.4** (Deferred Capabilities) table
5. **Update Coverage Metrics** to reflect deferral

---

### 8.4 Version Alignment Maintenance

When Master PRD or Roadmap versions change:

1. **Update this index** front matter (`master_prd_version`, `roadmap_version`)
2. **Audit all Feature PRDs** for version references
3. **Update Section 4** (Version Alignment Audit)
4. **Flag any drift** in Coverage Metrics

---

## 9. Automated Coverage Tracking (Future)

**Status:** Manual tracking in v1.0.0

**Future Enhancement (Phase 2+):**

Automate coverage tracking with:

```bash
# Proposed CLI commands (deferred)
$ capture docs-coverage --summary
$ capture docs-coverage --orphaned-specs
$ capture docs-coverage --version-drift
$ capture docs-coverage --missing-specs
```

**Trigger to Implement:** Documentation system exceeds 150 files OR manual tracking takes > 1 hour/week.

## Spec Architect's Nerdy Joke Corner

This capability index is like a GPS for your documentation—it tells you exactly where every feature lives, what specs exist, and which roads (ADRs) you must follow. Unlike actual GPS, it won't recalculate your route if you take a wrong turn into Phase 5 AI/ML territory when you should be in Phase 1 "make voice memos not disappear" land. Also, it doesn't have a passive-aggressive Australian accent option, which is unfortunate. 🗺️📍

Now go create those missing Foundation Monorepo specs before the monorepo setup becomes a circular dependency nightmare!

---

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ COMPLETED: Create `/docs/cross-cutting/spec-foundation-monorepo-arch.md`
2. ✅ COMPLETED: Create `/docs/cross-cutting/spec-foundation-monorepo-test.md`
3. ✅ READY: Begin Phase 1, Slice 1 (Walking Skeleton) - All documentation complete!

**Documentation Status:** PRODUCTION READY - All MPPP capabilities have 100% coverage with complete 4-document chains.
