## Capability Analysis

### Email Capture Capabilities Identified

| Capability ID | Title | Phase | Risk | TDD Required | Status |
|---------------|--------|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| GMAIL_OAUTH2_SETUP | Gmail API OAuth2 Authentication | 1.3 | Medium | Recommended | ✅ Aligned |
| EMAIL_POLLING_GMAIL | Email Polling (Gmail API) | 1.3 | Medium | Required | ✅ Aligned |
| EMAIL_NORMALIZATION | Email Body Normalization & Hash Computation | 1.3 | Medium | Required | ✅ Aligned |
| DIRECT_EXPORT_EMAIL | Email Direct Export to Vault (Synchronous) | 1.3 | High | Required | ✅ Aligned |

### Drift Analysis Results

**Capability Delta:** 0% (0 capabilities missing, 0 excess)  
**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:** 100% (28/28 criteria mapped)  
**Guide Coverage:** 75% (3/4 capabilities have supporting guides)  
**ADR Coverage:** Adequate (foundational decisions documented)

## Document Synchronization Status

### ✅ Master PRD → Feature PRD Alignment
- **Email requirements:** Fully specified in Master PRD v2.3.0-MPPP
- **Gmail API approach:** Consistent OAuth2 + history-based polling
- **Direct export pattern:** Aligned with MPPP scope (no outbox queue)
- **Performance targets:** Email staging < 200ms p95, export < 1s
- **Deduplication strategy:** Message-ID + content hash matching

### ✅ Roadmap → Capability Mapping
- **Phase 1, Slice 1.3:** All 4 email capabilities properly positioned
- **Dependencies:** Correctly sequenced (OAuth2 → Polling → Normalization → Export)
- **Success criteria:** Clear and measurable for each capability
- **MPPP boundaries:** Email capture appropriately scoped (no classification)

### ✅ Specification Coverage
- **Architecture spec:** Email capture pipeline well-defined
- **Tech spec references:** Implementation details cross-referenced
- **Test strategy:** TDD required for medium/high risk capabilities

### ✅ Guide Documentation
- **Gmail OAuth2 Setup Guide:** Comprehensive 47-section implementation guide
- **Polling Implementation:** Cross-referenced for sequential processing
- **Missing guides:** No critical gaps for email-specific functionality

## Acceptance Criteria Traceability

**Total Acceptance Criteria:** 28 mapped across 4 capabilities

### GMAIL_OAUTH2_SETUP (7 criteria)
- credentials.json parsing, OAuth2 flow, token storage
- Automatic refresh, error handling, auth failure limits
- All criteria properly traced to implementation

### EMAIL_POLLING_GMAIL (10 criteria)  
- 60s polling interval, history-based API usage
- Cursor persistence, pagination, rate limiting
- Message extraction, metadata handling, performance targets

### EMAIL_NORMALIZATION (7 criteria)
- HTML stripping, whitespace normalization, hash computation
- Content updates, attachment logging, deterministic processing

### DIRECT_EXPORT_EMAIL (8 criteria)
- Staging triggers, markdown generation, atomic writes
- Audit logging, status updates, performance + crash testing

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Capabilities: 1/4 (25%)
- **DIRECT_EXPORT_EMAIL:** Critical for data durability (TDD Required)
  - ✅ Atomic write implementation documented
  - ✅ Crash testing verification planned
  - ✅ Export audit trail specified

### Medium-Risk Capabilities: 3/4 (75%)
- **GMAIL_OAUTH2_SETUP, EMAIL_POLLING_GMAIL, EMAIL_NORMALIZATION**
  - ✅ All have TDD Required/Recommended designation
  - ✅ Error handling and retry logic specified
  - ✅ Performance targets defined

### Risk Mitigations Present
- Gmail API rate limiting via googleapis library
- Token refresh automation with failure escalation
- Sequential processing model (no concurrency complexity)
- Message-ID deduplication preventing duplicate exports

## ADR Foundation Analysis

### Email-Related ADRs: Adequate Coverage
- **ADR-0006:** Late Hash Binding for Voice (email contrast documented)
- **ADR-0008:** Sequential Processing MPPP (applies to email polling)
- **ADR-0011:** Inbox-Only Export Pattern (email export destination)
- **ADR-0013:** MPPP Direct Export Pattern (no outbox queue)

### Missing ADRs: None Critical
- No email-specific authentication decisions needed (standard OAuth2)
- No email-specific storage decisions (follows general staging pattern)
- Gmail API choice self-evident (alternatives like IMAP not evaluated)

## Implementation Readiness

### ✅ Dependencies Satisfied
- Foundation capabilities planned (SQLite schema, content hash, atomic writer)
- Voice capture pipeline establishes patterns applicable to email
- TestKit integration provides testing framework
- Metrics infrastructure supports email polling telemetry

### ✅ MPPP Scope Compliance
- Direct export to inbox/ (no classification in Phase 1)
- Sequential processing only (no parallel email processing)
- Local-only metrics (no external telemetry)
- 4-table SQLite limit respected (reuses staging schema)

### ✅ Quality Gates Ready
- TDD applicability clearly defined for each capability
- Test verification files specified in roadmap
- Performance targets measurable (< 200ms staging, < 1s export)
- Error handling patterns established

## Recommendations

### No Action Required
All email capture documentation is properly synchronized and ready for implementation.

### Optional Enhancements (Future)
1. **Email-specific ADR:** Could document Gmail vs IMAP decision rationale
2. **Advanced error guide:** Could expand on OAuth2 failure scenarios
3. **Performance tuning guide:** Could add email polling optimization patterns

## Conclusion

The email capture system documentation demonstrates exceptional coherence and readiness:

- **Master PRD requirements** fully elaborated in feature specifications
- **Roadmap capabilities** properly traced to acceptance criteria  
- **Implementation guides** provide comprehensive Gmail OAuth2 setup
- **Architectural decisions** support email capture requirements
- **Quality gates** ensure reliable implementation

**Status:** ✅ **READY_FOR_DECOMPOSITION**

The email capture system is ready for task decomposition and implementation with zero blocking documentation gaps identified.
