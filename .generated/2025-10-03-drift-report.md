**Critical Path (Must Complete First):**

1. **MONOREPO_STRUCTURE** → Foundation for all other capabilities
2. **SQLITE_SCHEMA** → Required by all storage operations
3. **CONTENT_HASH_IMPLEMENTATION** → Required by deduplication
4. **ATOMIC_FILE_WRITER** → Required by export operations

**Voice Capture Chain:**

MONOREPO_STRUCTURE → SQLITE_SCHEMA, CONTENT_HASH_IMPLEMENTATION → VOICE_POLLING_ICLOUD → WHISPER_TRANSCRIPTION → DEDUPLICATION_LOGIC → DIRECT_EXPORT_VOICE

**Email Capture Chain:**

MONOREPO_STRUCTURE → SQLITE_SCHEMA, CONTENT_HASH_IMPLEMENTATION → GMAIL_OAUTH2_SETUP → EMAIL_POLLING_GMAIL → EMAIL_NORMALIZATION → DEDUPLICATION_LOGIC → DIRECT_EXPORT_EMAIL

**Error Recovery Chain:**

SQLITE_SCHEMA, CAPTURE_STATE_MACHINE → CRASH_RECOVERY_MECHANISM → FAULT_INJECTION_FRAMEWORK

**Backup Chain:**

SQLITE_SCHEMA → HOURLY_BACKUP_AUTOMATION → BACKUP_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL → RETENTION_POLICY_90DAY

**Finding:** Dependency graph is **acyclic and valid**. All dependencies are resolvable. No GAP::ARCH-MISMATCH detected.
