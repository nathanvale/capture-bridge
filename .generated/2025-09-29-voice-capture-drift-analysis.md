# Voice Capture Documentation Drift Analysis

**Analysis Date:** 2025-09-29
**Scope:** Voice capture system documentation coherence
**Status:** NEEDS_ROADMAP_PATCH
**Documents Analyzed:** 8 core documents, 2 ADRs, 2 guides

## Executive Summary

The voice capture system documentation shows **moderate drift** with several inconsistencies between the master PRD, feature specifications, and roadmap. While no blocking gaps exist, the drift exceeds the 5% threshold requiring roadmap patches and documentation alignment.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Architecture alignment:** Core principles consistent across documents
- ⚠️ **Version mismatches:** Multiple documents reference different PRD versions
- ⚠️ **Phase scope drift:** Some capabilities misaligned between roadmap and specs
- ❌ **Test coverage gaps:** Critical APFS dataless file tests missing from implementation
- ✅ **ADR compliance:** Voice file sovereignty consistently enforced

## Document Analysis Matrix

| Document | Version | Master PRD Alignment | Roadmap Alignment | Status |
|----------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Master PRD | 2.3.0-MPPP | ✅ Source of Truth | ✅ Aligned | Living |
| Roadmap | 3.0.0 | ✅ Aligned | ✅ Source of Truth | Living |
| Capture PRD | 1.3.0-MPPP | ✅ Aligned | ⚠️ Version drift | Living |
| Capture Arch Spec | 1.0.0 | ⚠️ Superseded sections | ⚠️ Outbox references | Living |
| Capture Tech Spec | 0.2.0-MPPP | ✅ Aligned | ✅ Aligned | Draft |
| Capture Test Spec | 0.1.0 | ✅ Aligned | ❌ Incomplete coverage | Draft |
| Voice Debug Guide | 1.0.0 | ✅ Aligned | ✅ Aligned | Approved |
| ADR-0001 | 0.1.0 | ✅ Aligned | ✅ Aligned | Accepted |
| ADR-0006 | 0.1.0 | ✅ Aligned | ✅ Aligned | Accepted |

## Critical Drift Issues

### 1. Phase Scope Inconsistencies (MEDIUM IMPACT)

**Issue:** Capture Architecture Spec contains outdated outbox queue references despite MPPP scope reduction.

**Evidence:**
- Architecture spec describes "Outbox Queue" component (marked as deferred)
- Master PRD v2.3.0-MPPP explicitly uses Direct Export Pattern
- Tech spec correctly aligned with Direct Export Pattern

**Impact:** Potential confusion during implementation

**Recommendation:** Update architecture spec to remove outbox references, add direct export flow diagram

### 2. Version Reference Drift (LOW IMPACT)

**Issue:** Multiple documents reference different roadmap versions.

**Evidence:**
- Capture PRD references: `roadmap_version: 2.0.0-MPPP`
- Current roadmap version: `3.0.0`
- Other specs have inconsistent version references

**Impact:** Documentation navigation confusion

**Recommendation:** Standardize all documents to reference roadmap v3.0.0

### 3. Test Coverage Gap - APFS Dataless Files (HIGH IMPACT)

**Issue:** Critical test patterns defined but not implemented.

**Evidence:**
- Test spec defines comprehensive APFS dataless file test patterns (Section 4.1)
- Roadmap shows VOICE_POLLING_ICLOUD capability as "Not started"
- Debug guide provides extensive troubleshooting but tests missing

**Impact:** High-risk capability without test coverage

**Recommendation:** Implement APFS dataless file tests before Phase 1.2 completion

## Capability Mapping Analysis

### Voice Capture Pipeline Capabilities

| Capability | Master PRD | Roadmap | Capture PRD | Tech Spec | Test Spec |
|------------|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Voice Polling | ✅ Defined | ✅ VOICE_POLLING_ICLOUD | ✅ Detailed | ✅ Detailed | ⚠️ Partial |
| APFS Handling | ✅ Mentioned | ✅ Dependencies | ✅ Sovereignty | ✅ Comprehensive | ❌ Missing tests |
| Transcription | ✅ Whisper Medium | ✅ WHISPER_TRANSCRIPTION | ✅ Sequential | ✅ Detailed | ✅ Covered |
| Deduplication | ✅ SHA-256 | ✅ DEDUPLICATION_LOGIC | ✅ Content hash | ✅ Deterministic | ✅ Covered |
| Direct Export | ✅ Inbox only | ✅ DIRECT_EXPORT_VOICE | ✅ ULID naming | ✅ Atomic writes | ✅ Covered |

### Acceptance Criteria Traceability

**✅ Well-Mapped Criteria:**
- Voice capture operational (poll → transcribe → export)
- Deduplication working (hash + audio_fp)
- Export to vault (inbox/ flat structure)
- Audit trail complete (exports_audit table)

**⚠️ Partially Mapped Criteria:**
- "APFS dataless handling" - mentioned but test implementation missing
- "Sequential processing" - defined but performance validation incomplete

**❌ Unmapped Criteria:**
- None identified (strong traceability overall)

## ADR Compliance Analysis

### ADR-0001: Voice File Sovereignty ✅ COMPLIANT

**Requirement:** Never move/copy Apple Voice Memo files

**Compliance Evidence:**
- Master PRD: "Voice file sovereignty (reference-only, never move)"
- Capture PRD: "Voice memo sovereignty is preserved"
- Tech spec: "Voice File Sovereignty Violations (path/fingerprint mismatch)"
- Architecture: "Store references, not voice binaries"

**Status:** ✅ Consistently enforced across all documents

### ADR-0006: Late Hash Binding ✅ COMPLIANT

**Requirement:** Immediate staging with NULL hash, bind after transcription

**Compliance Evidence:**
- Master PRD: "Late hash binding (voice)" in dependencies
- Roadmap: Listed as dependency for WHISPER_TRANSCRIPTION
- Tech spec: Detailed implementation with staging flow
- Architecture: State machine supports NULL → SHA-256 transition

**Status:** ✅ Properly implemented in specifications

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas Requiring Attention

1. **APFS Dataless File Handling** (Risk: High)
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide exists
   - Test patterns defined but not implemented
   - Critical for voice capture reliability

2. **Performance Under Load** (Risk: Medium)
   - Large library optimization documented
   - Performance targets defined
   - Load testing patterns incomplete

3. **iCloud Sync Dependencies** (Risk: Medium)
   - Extensive debugging procedures documented
   - Network failure recovery defined
   - Integration testing with real iCloud needed

### Risk Mitigation Status

| Risk Area | Detection | Mitigation | Testing |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Data Loss | ✅ WAL mode | ✅ Staging ledger | ✅ Crash recovery tests |
| Duplicates | ✅ Content hash | ✅ Dedup logic | ✅ Unit tests |
| File Missing | ✅ Fingerprint check | ✅ Quarantine flag | ⚠️ Integration tests needed |
| Transcription Fail | ✅ Placeholder export | ✅ Retry logic | ✅ Failure tests |

## Guide Integration Assessment

### Voice Capture Debugging Guide ✅ COMPREHENSIVE

**Strengths:**
- Covers all major failure modes
- Provides systematic diagnostic approaches
- Includes performance troubleshooting
- System-level debugging techniques

**Coverage Areas:**
- APFS dataless file download failures ✅
- iCloud synchronization issues ✅
- Transcription failures and timeouts ✅
- Duplicate voice memo handling ✅
- Performance optimization for large libraries ✅

**Integration with Specs:**
- ✅ Cross-references tech specs correctly
- ✅ Aligns with ADR-0001 sovereignty principles
- ✅ Supports test spec failure scenarios

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Week 1)

1. **Update Architecture Spec**
   - Remove outbox queue references
   - Add direct export flow diagram
   - Update to reference roadmap v3.0.0

2. **Standardize Version References**
   - Update all `roadmap_version` fields to `3.0.0`
   - Ensure `master_prd_version` consistency across specs

3. **Implement APFS Test Patterns**
   - Prioritize test implementation from spec-capture-test.md Section 4.1
   - Add integration tests for dataless file handling

### Short-term (Phase 1.2)

1. **Complete Test Coverage**
   - Implement missing APFS dataless file tests
   - Add performance tests for large voice memo libraries
   - Validate iCloud sync recovery scenarios

2. **Documentation Cross-Reference Audit**
   - Verify all ADR references are current
   - Update broken internal links
   - Ensure guide integration is complete

### Medium-term (Phase 2)

1. **Operational Readiness**
   - Validate all debug guide procedures
   - Test recovery scenarios with real iCloud issues
   - Performance tune based on production usage

## Conclusion

The voice capture documentation demonstrates **strong architectural consistency** with proper ADR compliance and comprehensive troubleshooting coverage. The main drift areas are **version references** and **test implementation gaps** rather than fundamental design inconsistencies.

**Orchestrator Decision:** NEEDS_ROADMAP_PATCH

**Rationale:** While no blocking issues exist, the combination of version drift, outdated architecture references, and missing critical tests exceeds the 5% drift threshold. The system is ready for implementation with the recommended patches applied.

**Next Steps:**
1. Apply version standardization patches
2. Update architecture spec to remove outbox references
3. Implement APFS dataless file tests
4. Proceed with Phase 1.2 voice capture pipeline implementation
