# Review Task Command

**Purpose:** Comprehensive P0123 review of completed VTM tasks with automated report generation

**Usage:**

- `/review-task <task-id>` - Review specific completed task
- `/review-task latest` - Review most recently completed task

---

## Command Handler

When this command is invoked, execute the following workflow:

### Phase 1: Validate Task & Load Context

#### Step 1A: Get Task Information

```bash
# Get task details from VTM
node .claude/scripts/vtm-status.mjs --task <task-id>
```

**Validation:**
- Task must exist in VTM
- Task status must be "completed" in task-state.json
- Task must have PR merged or at least created

**If validation fails:**
```markdown
‚ùå Cannot review task: <reason>

**Task ID:** <task-id>
**Current Status:** <status>

**Action Required:**
- For in-progress tasks: Complete with `/pm start`
- For blocked tasks: Run `/pm blocked`
```

#### Step 1B: Load All Context Files

Read EVERY file in task's context (same as `/pm start`):

```typescript
const contextFiles = [
  ...task.related_specs,
  ...task.related_adrs,
  ...task.related_guides,
  '.claude/rules/testkit-tdd-guide-condensed.md',
  '.claude/rules/prd-master-condensed.md',
  '.claude/rules/typescript-patterns-condensed.md'
]

for (const filePath of contextFiles) {
  Read({ file_path: filePath })
}
```

#### Step 1C: Identify Changed Files

```bash
# Get PR number from task-state.json
pr_number=$(jq -r ".tasks[\"${task_id}\"].pr_number" docs/backlog/task-state.json)

# Get changed files from PR
gh pr view ${pr_number} --json files --jq '.files[].path'
```

**For each changed file:**
1. Read the current file content
2. Get git diff to see what changed:
   ```bash
   git diff main...feat/${task_id} -- ${file_path}
   ```

### Phase 2: Invoke Code Reviewer Agent

Delegate to code-reviewer agent with full context:

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  description: `P0123 Review: ${task_id}`,
  prompt: `**COMPREHENSIVE CODE REVIEW - ${task_id}**

**Task Context:**
- **ID:** ${task_id}
- **Title:** ${task.title}
- **Risk Level:** ${task.risk}
- **Phase/Slice:** ${task.phase}/${task.slice}
- **PR:** #${pr_number}

**Acceptance Criteria Completed:**
${task.acceptance_criteria.map((ac, i) => `${i+1}. ${ac.text}`).join('\n')}

**Specifications (VERBATIM):**
${extracted_spec_content}

**Architecture Decisions (ADRs):**
${extracted_adr_content}

**Implementation Guidelines:**
${extracted_guide_content}

**Changed Files:**
${changed_files.map(f => `- ${f.path}`).join('\n')}

**File Contents & Diffs:**
${for_each_changed_file}
---
**File:** ${file.path}

**Diff:**
\`\`\`diff
${git_diff_output}
\`\`\`

**Full Current Content:**
\`\`\`${file.language}
${file.content}
\`\`\`

${end_for}

## YOUR MISSION: P0123 CODE REVIEW

Perform a comprehensive review across **ALL risk dimensions** (P0, P1, P2, P3):

### P0 - Critical Production Risks (BLOCKING)
**You MUST identify and flag:**
- **Security vulnerabilities** (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, secrets exposure)
- **Data loss risks** (missing transactions, unsafe deletions, race conditions)
- **Crash/corruption risks** (unhandled errors, null pointer exceptions)
- **Breaking changes** (API contract violations, schema migrations without backfill)
- **Resource leaks** (unclosed connections, file handles, memory leaks)

**For EACH P0 issue found:**
- Exact location (file:line)
- Severity explanation
- Attack vector or failure scenario
- Remediation required

### P1 - High-Impact Quality Issues (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)
**You SHOULD identify:**
- **Test coverage gaps** (critical paths untested, edge cases missing)
- **Error handling gaps** (catch without logging, silent failures)
- **Performance issues** (N+1 queries, missing indexes, blocking I/O)
- **Type safety violations** (any casts, non-null assertions without guards)
- **Architectural violations** (breaking MPPP constraints, violating ADRs)

**For EACH P1 issue:**
- Location
- Impact description
- Suggested fix

### P2 - Code Quality & Maintainability (RECOMMENDED)
**You SHOULD highlight:**
- **Code smells** (long functions, deep nesting, high complexity)
- **Duplication** (copy-paste code, missed abstraction opportunities)
- **Naming issues** (unclear variable names, misleading function names)
- **Missing documentation** (complex logic without comments)
- **Technical debt** (TODOs, temporary hacks, missing refactoring)

**For EACH P2 issue:**
- Location
- Refactoring suggestion
- Benefit explanation

### P3 - Style & Best Practices (OPTIONAL)
**You MAY note:**
- **Style inconsistencies** (formatting, import order)
- **Best practice opportunities** (modern patterns, language features)
- **Optimization opportunities** (minor performance gains)
