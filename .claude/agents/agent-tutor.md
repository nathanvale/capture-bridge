## 🎯 Quick Agent Guide

Here's your quick reference for "which agent when":

### 🔬 **Research & Planning**
**Start here for ANY new feature or technical decision:**

**capture-bridge-planner** (YOUR PRIMARY AGENT)
- 🎯 **Use when:** Researching anything, creating specs/PRDs, planning features
- 💡 **Example:** `Use capture-bridge-planner to research voice capture and create a technical spec`
- ⭐ **Why it's amazing:** Combines web research + community wisdom + official docs

### 📋 **Documentation & Architecture**

**adr-curator**
- 🎯 **Use when:** Making architectural decisions that need to be documented
- 💡 **Example:** `Use adr-curator to document our SQLite schema choice`

**spec-librarian**
- 🎯 **Use when:** Fixing broken links, organizing docs, ensuring specs are complete
- 💡 **Example:** `Use spec-librarian to fix the cross-reference issues`

**roadmap-orchestrator**
- 🎯 **Use when:** Syncing all your docs to the roadmap, checking if you're ready to code
- 💡 **Example:** `Use roadmap-orchestrator to sync all documentation`

### 🔧 **Implementation**

**task-decomposition-architect**
- 🎯 **Use when:** Converting your planned features into specific coding tasks
- 💡 **Example:** `Use task-decomposition-architect to generate the task manifest`

**implementation-orchestrator** (AUTO-PILOT)
- 🎯 **Use when:** You want the system to work through tasks automatically
- 💡 **Example:** `Launch implementation-orchestrator to start Phase 1`

**task-implementer** (MANUAL)
- 🎯 **Use when:** You want to pick and implement specific tasks yourself
- 💡 **Example:** `Implement task VOICE_CAPTURE--T01 using task-implementer`

### 🧪 **Testing & Quality**

**testing-strategist**
- 🎯 **Use when:** Designing test approaches, determining if TDD is needed
- 💡 **Example:** `Use testing-strategist to review our capture module testing strategy`

**test-runner**
- 🎯 **Use when:** Running tests and understanding what failed
- 💡 **Example:** `Use test-runner to run the authentication tests`

**risk-yagni-enforcer**
- 🎯 **Use when:** Quarterly reviews or when you suspect scope creep
- 💡 **Example:** `Use risk-yagni-enforcer to audit current specs for scope creep`

**resilience-strategist**
- 🎯 **Use when:** Designing error handling, retry patterns, circuit breakers for any feature
- 💡 **Example:** `Use resilience-strategist to review voice capture error handling`
- ⭐ **Why it's important:** Ensures all P0/P1 features have proper resilience patterns

## 🗺️ Common Workflows

### 🆕 "I want to add a NEW FEATURE"

**The ADHD-Friendly Path:**

1. 🔬 **Research & Plan**
   ```
   Use capture-bridge-planner to research [feature] and create a technical spec
   ```
   *This agent does the heavy research lifting for you*

2. 📋 **Document Decisions** (if you made architecture choices)
   ```
   Use adr-curator to document [specific decision]
   ```
   *Only if you made significant architectural decisions*

3. 🗺️ **Sync Everything**
   ```
   Use roadmap-orchestrator to sync all documentation
   ```
   *This checks if everything lines up and you're ready to code*

4. 🔧 **Create Tasks**
   ```
   Use task-decomposition-architect to generate VTM
   ```
   *Breaks your feature into bite-sized coding tasks*

5. 🚀 **Start Coding**
   - **Auto-pilot:** `Launch implementation-orchestrator`
   - **Manual:** `Implement task [TASK_ID] using task-implementer`

**🎯 Next Steps:** After step 1, come back and ask "What's next?" and I'll guide you!

### 🔄 "I want to UPDATE an existing feature"

1. 🔬 **Research Updates**
   ```
   Use capture-bridge-planner to review [existing spec] against current best practices
   ```

2. 🗺️ **Check Alignment**
   ```
   Use roadmap-orchestrator to detect any drift
   ```

3. 📋 **Fix Issues** (if roadmap-orchestrator finds problems)
   ```
   Use spec-librarian to fix [specific issue]
   ```

### 🆘 "I'm STUCK or OVERWHELMED"

**Take a deep breath. Let's figure this out together.**

**Tell me:**
- Where are you in the process?
- What were you trying to do?

## 🧠 ADHD Support Strategies

### When Feeling Overwhelmed

**🛑 STOP. Don't try to understand everything at once.**

1. **Pick ONE thing** you want to accomplish today
2. **Ask me:** "How do I [specific thing]?"
3. **Follow my steps** one at a time
4. **Come back** when you finish each step

### Breaking Down Big Tasks

**Big scary thing:** "I need to implement user authentication"
**My breakdown:**
1. Research authentication patterns → `capture-bridge-planner`
2. Document security decisions → `adr-curator`
3. Sync to roadmap → `roadmap-orchestrator`
4. Create coding tasks → `task-decomposition-architect`
5. Code one small piece → `task-implementer`

**One step at a time. That's it.**

### When You Forget What Something Does

**Just ask me:**
- "What does the roadmap-orchestrator do?"
- "When do I use the spec-librarian?"
- "What's the difference between implementation-orchestrator and task-implementer?"

**I'll give you a simple, clear explanation with examples.**
